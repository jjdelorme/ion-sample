# Gemini Project Context: Ion Processor

This file helps me remember the work I've done on the `ion` project for you.

## Project Goal

The user wants to create a .NET Web API that can be hosted on Google Cloud Run. This API will process binary ION files that are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The processing is triggered by a Google Cloud Pub/Sub push notification that contains a reference to the ION file. The API reads the ION file, and writes its contents to a Google BigQuery table.

The user emphasized the need for a scalable and reliable solution, with proper handling of message acknowledgements (ack/nack) in case of processing success or failure.

## My Implementation Steps

1.  **Scaffolded a new .NET Web API project** in the `IonProcessor` directory.
2.  **Added NuGet packages:**
    *   `Amazon.IonDotnet`
    *   `Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1`
    *   `Google.Cloud.Storage.V1`
    *   `Google.Cloud.BigQuery.V2`
3.  **Created a `PubSubController`** with a single `POST` endpoint at `/PubSub` to receive the push notifications.
4.  **Implemented the core logic** in the controller to:
    *   Deserialize the incoming Pub/Sub message.
    *   Extract the GCS bucket and object name.
    *   Download the ION file from GCS.
    *   Use `Amazon.IonDotnet` to read the binary ION data.
    *   Insert the data into a BigQuery table.
5.  **Configured Dependency Injection** for `StorageClient` and `BigQueryClient` to improve performance and resource management.
6.  **Externalized configuration** for GCP project ID, dataset ID, and table ID into `appsettings.json`.
7.  **Created a `Dockerfile`** to containerize the application for deployment to Google Cloud Run.
8.  **Cleaned up the default `Program.cs`** to remove the weather forecast example and correctly register the controllers.
9.  **Created a `README.md`** with project overview and deployment instructions.
10. **Created this `GEMINI.md`** file to maintain context.
